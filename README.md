# SQL-x-NODE-mini_project
This is my node express project which helps u perform CRUD operations on a database created using npm's faker package
MethodOverride package is also used to perform PUT and DELETE methods in ejs

Here I have used Express,Ejs and SQL.

And a little bit of bootstrap was used as well to give a somewhat visually appealing look
